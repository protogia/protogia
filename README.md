## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

my name is Giancarlo Rizzo and I'm working as a Technical Engineer at Deutsches Luft- und Raumfahrtzentrum at _Institute for Transportation Systems_. I'm responsible for maintaining of technical infrastructure for Object-Detection in realtime traffic and V2X-Communication.

Aside my work as engineer I like to work on small hardware-projects and linux-related stuff.
